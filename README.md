My First To-Do List in Full React
Welcome to my first React project! ðŸŽ‰

This is a fully functional To-Do List application built entirely with React. The app allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks, while also persisting data using local storage. It's a simple yet powerful way to manage your daily tasks and get started with React development.

Features
Add Tasks: Easily add new to-dos to your list.

Edit Tasks: Update any task in the list with just a click.

Delete Tasks: Remove tasks you no longer need.

Data Persistence: All tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so your list is always available.

Technologies Used

React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Local Storage: To persist data across sessions.

CSS: For styling the application.

What I Learned!

How to use React hooks like useState and useEffect.

Passing props between components.

Managing state and implementing CRUD operations in React.

Storing and retrieving data from local storage.


Thank you for checking out my project! This has been an exciting learning experience, and I look forward to creating more advanced applications with React.

Feel free to reach out if you have any feedback or suggestions. ðŸ˜Š

Enjoy exploring the project, and happy coding! ðŸš€
